  ## Introduction


  In this lesson, you'll learn how to create a beautiful landscape of snowflakes
  using Python's Turtle graphics library. As you follow the instructions, you'll
  encounter questions that will help you understand key parts of Python
  programming. Let's get started!


  ## Setting Up


  1. **Importing the Turtle Module**\
     Begin by importing the Turtle module. What is the purpose of the `import` statement in Python?

     ```python
     import turtle
     ```

  2. **Creating a Turtle Object**\
     Create a Turtle object named `snowflake`. What does the `turtle.Turtle()` function do?

     ```python
     snowflake = turtle.Turtle()
     ```

  3. **Setting the Background**\
     Set the background color to a wintery blue. How do you change the background color in Turtle?

     ```python
     turtle.bgcolor("light blue")
     ```
