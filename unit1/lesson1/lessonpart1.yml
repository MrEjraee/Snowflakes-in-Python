  ## Introduction


  In this lesson, you'll learn how to create a beautiful landscape of snowflakes
  using Python's Turtle graphics library. As you follow the instructions, you'll
  encounter questions that will help you understand key parts of Python
  programming. Let's get started!


  ## Setting Up


  1. **Importing the Turtle Module**  
     Begin by importing the Turtle module. What is the purpose of the `import` statement in Python?

     ```python
     import turtle
     ```

  2. **Creating a Turtle Object**  
     Create a Turtle object named `snowflake`. What does the `turtle.Turtle()` function do?

     ```python
     snowflake = turtle.Turtle()
     ```

  3. **Setting the Background**  
     Set the background color to a wintery blue. How do you change the background color in Turtle?

     ```python
     turtle.bgcolor("light blue")
     ```

  ## Drawing a Snowflake


  1. **Defining a Function**  
     Define a function named `draw_snowflake` that takes a Turtle object as a parameter. Why is it useful to use functions in your code?

     ```python
     def draw_snowflake(t):
     ```

  2. **Drawing a Single Branch**  
     Inside the function, use a loop to draw a single branch of the snowflake. How does a `for` loop work in Python?

     ```python
     for _ in range(6):
         t.forward(100)
         t.backward(100)
         t.right(60)
     ```

  3. **Creating the Full Snowflake**  
     Call the `draw_snowflake` function to draw the complete snowflake. How do you call a function in Python?

     ```python
     draw_snowflake(snowflake)
     ```

  ## Enhancing the Landscape


  1. **Positioning the Turtle**  
     Use the `penup()` and `pendown()` methods to move the Turtle without drawing. What is the difference between `penup()` and `pendown()`?

     ```python
     snowflake.penup()
     snowflake.goto(-150, 0)
     snowflake.pendown()
     ```

  2. **Drawing Multiple Snowflakes**  
     Use a loop to draw multiple snowflakes at different positions. How can loops help in reducing repetitive code?

     ```python
     for _ in range(3):
         draw_snowflake(snowflake)
         snowflake.penup()
         snowflake.forward(150)
         snowflake.pendown()
     ```

  ## Conclusion


  Congratulations! You've created a beautiful landscape of snowflakes using
  Python Turtle. Reflect on the questions and try experimenting with different
  colors and sizes to make your snowflakes unique. What other shapes can you
  create using similar techniques?
